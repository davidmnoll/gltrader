# GLTrader

This is a GUI interface for automated crypto trading commissioned by a client.  It is meant to provide easy access to market data to easily process and trigger various trading strategies while providing a visual interface to monitor the kinds of trades that are being executed.

The GUI is built on the Kivy Framework.  It is currently compatible with the Bittrex API.  It uses [Eric Somdahl's bittrex Python API Wrapper](https://github.com/ericsomdahl/python-bittrex) to run API calls and update the GUI.
